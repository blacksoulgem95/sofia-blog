## REST vs GraphQL: Is It Really a War?

### Introduction

<p>REST and GraphQL are often portrayed as rival technologies. REST, introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000, became the web's dominant API style. GraphQL, created by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, rose as a solution to some limitations of REST. But are they really at war? Or just two different tools in our dev toolbox?</p>

### Core Concepts

#### What is REST?

<p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) to access resources via endpoints. It’s stateless, uses URLs to identify data, and is often used with JSON. REST APIs are simple, cacheable, and widely supported.</p>

#### What is GraphQL?

<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs. Instead of multiple endpoints, it uses a single endpoint where clients ask exactly for the data they need. It uses a typed schema and resolvers to handle requests, reducing over- and under-fetching.</p>

### Comparison

#### Data Fetching

<p>REST requires multiple calls for related data. GraphQL lets you query nested data in a single request. Example:</p>

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

<p>This returns exactly the requested fields—no more, no less.</p>

#### Flexibility and Control

<p>GraphQL gives more power to the client, REST gives more control to the server. GraphQL clients define the shape of the response, while REST defines it per endpoint.</p>

#### Versioning

<p>REST typically uses URL versioning (<code>/api/v1</code>). GraphQL avoids versioning by allowing evolution via schema changes and field deprecation.</p>

#### Tooling and Community

<ul>
  <li>REST: Mature ecosystem, supported by Swagger/OpenAPI, cURL, Postman, etc.</li>
  <li>GraphQL: Powerful developer tools like GraphiQL, Apollo, and introspection.</li>
</ul>

#### Performance Implications

<ul>
  <li>REST: Better native HTTP caching</li>
  <li>GraphQL: Reduces number of network calls</li>
  <li>GraphQL: Higher server-side processing complexity</li>
</ul>

### Use Cases

#### When to use REST

<ul>
  <li>Simple CRUD APIs</li>
  <li>Need for caching/CDN</li>
  <li>Broad client compatibility</li>
  <li>Rapid prototyping</li>
</ul>

#### When to use GraphQL

<ul>
  <li>Complex data needs with nesting</li>
  <li>Multiple frontend clients (mobile, web)</li>
  <li>Real-time subscriptions</li>
  <li>Reducing over-fetching</li>
</ul>

### Common Misconceptions

<ul>
  <li><strong>“GraphQL is always better”:</strong> Not true. Depends on context and complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>“REST is outdated”:</strong> REST is still dominant and evolving.</li>
  <li><strong>“You have to choose one”:</strong> False. Hybrid architectures are common and useful.</li>
</ul>

### Conclusion

<p>There’s no API war—just different approaches. REST is mature, stable, and well-suited for simple, cacheable data. GraphQL offers flexibility, reduces round-trips, and empowers frontend developers.</p>

<p>Choose based on your project’s needs, not hype. Sometimes, the best choice is… both.</p>
