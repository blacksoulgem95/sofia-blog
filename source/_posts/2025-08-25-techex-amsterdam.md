A quick update: Iâ€™ll be in **Amsterdam for TechEx on 24â€“25 September**!

Iâ€™m really looking forward to a couple of days full of talks, demos, and hallway chats â€” the kind where you start off
talking about APIs and somehow end up sketching half a product idea on a napkin. Thatâ€™s the magic of these events.

Mostly, Iâ€™m excited to dive into the API and backend sessions, catch up on the latest tools (probably too many), and
meet people who are just as obsessed with this stuff as I am. And yes, there will definitely be coffee-fueled debates
about which tech is better for backend, Java, Node, Python or PHP, and whatever else comes up.

If youâ€™re around:

- Come say hi during the breaks (Iâ€™ll probably be hovering near the espresso machine).
- Wave if you see me wandering the expo hall, hypnotized by another shiny DevOps tool.
- And if you know where to get the best stroopwafels nearby, please, please tell me.

Thatâ€™s all for now â€” see you in **Amsterdam, 24â€“25 September**.  
Itâ€™s going to be fun ðŸš€
